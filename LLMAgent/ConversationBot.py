# [HOW TO GENERATE TRAFFIC REPORTS]
# Act as a human. And provide as much information as possible, including file path and tabular datasets.
# When human need to provede a report of the traffic situation of a road network, they usually start by observing the operation of the network,
# find a few intersections in the network that are in a poor operating condition, as well as their locations, try to optimize them,
# and evaluate which parameters have become better and which ones are worse after the optimization. And form a report of the complete thought process in markdown format.
# For example:
# Macroscopic traffic operations on the entire road network can be viewed on the basis of road network heatmaps: 'replace the correct filepath here'.
# To be more specific, these 5 intersections are in the worst operation status.
